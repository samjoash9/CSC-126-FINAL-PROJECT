Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

For state of the art Computer Vision training notebooks you can use with this dataset,

The dataset includes 362 images.
Objects are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -13 and +13 degrees
* Random shear of between -9째 to +9째 horizontally and -9째 to +9째 vertically
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.6 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.49 percent of pixels
